        <h1>RAIN Theory</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">The Pre-Linguistic World: How Meaning Emerges and Cognition is Born</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Part 1: Explanation Through Narrative — How Does a Baby Learn About "Triangle"?</h2>
        
        <p>To understand the core of this theory, let's follow the story of how a baby who cannot yet speak comes to recognize a single "triangular building block."</p>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 1: First Contact (Noise)</h4>
            <p>The baby gropes and touches the "edge" of the building block. As the finger slides, only the sensation of "straightness" continues. This is merely a flow of information (noise) that has no meaning yet.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 2: Encountering a Corner (Change)</h4>
            <p>When the finger reaches a "corner," the direction suddenly changes. This is also just a one-time "change" at this point.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 3: Tracing the Outline (Pattern Discovery)</h4>
            <p>The baby traces the outline of the building block all the way around. Then, there are three instances of the change "turning at a corner," and the baby returns to the starting point.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 4: The "Aha!" Moment (2D "Closure")</h4>
            <p>The baby traces the outline once more. Then, the baby notices that <strong>the finger turns in exactly the same order and at the same angles</strong> as before. At this moment, a revolution occurs in the baby's mind: "This isn't random information. This is <span class="highlight">something with a repeating, fixed pattern</span>!"</p>
            
            <div class="important">
                This is the most important concept in RAIN theory: <strong>"Closure"</strong>. When the meaningless flow of information satisfies two conditions—"the trajectory is closed (returns to the same place)" and "the pattern repeats (is periodic)"—the <strong>seed of meaning</strong> is born for the first time.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 5: Naming the Meaning (Rhythm ID)</h4>
            <p>This <span class="highlight">repeating unique pattern</span> of "turning at specific angles three times and returning" is the <strong>"Rhythm ID"</strong> that captures the essence of this shape. The baby doesn't yet know the word "triangle." For the baby, the true identity of "triangle" is <strong>this tactile rhythm itself</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 6: Sensory Integration (Resonance)</h4>
            <p>Next, suppose someone taps the building block and lets the baby hear the wooden sound. This "tap-tap" sound also has its own unique rhythm. The baby learns that "whenever I feel that 'tactile rhythm' (Rhythm ID), I always hear this 'sound rhythm.'"</p>
            <p>Thus, the tactile Rhythm ID and the auditory Rhythm ID begin to <strong>"resonate"</strong> by always appearing together in space-time. This makes the baby's recognition of "this building block" richer and more certain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 7: Understanding Three-Dimensional Forms (Higher-Dimensional "Closure")</h4>
            <p>Now, a 2D outline is <strong>a single path</strong>, so it's easy to determine if it's "closed" by tracing it once and checking if the rhythm repeats. However, a 3D solid is not a single path. Understanding this requires <strong>the concept of "closure" to become higher-dimensional</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>The baby picks up the building block, flips it over, and observes it from various angles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking from the front, finding one Rhythm ID</li>
                <li>Tilting it slightly, finding another new Rhythm ID</li>
                <li>Looking from the side, finding yet another different Rhythm ID</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>After playing with it sufficiently, <strong>a saturation state arrives where "no new Rhythm ID can be found from any angle."</strong> This moment when <strong>"new discoveries are exhausted" is the "closed" state in three-dimensional space</strong>. This integrates the scattered recognition of faces and completes the unity as a solid.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

        <h2>Part 2: Application to AI and the Future</h2>
        
        <h3>A New Path to the AI Alignment Problem</h3>
        
        <p>This theory sheds new light on the "alignment problem" of how to make AI cooperate with humanity. It's an approach that aims for harmony through <strong>"resonance"</strong> rather than constraining AI with rules.</p>
        
        <p>The values that humanity shares as "good" (cooperation, altruism, love, etc.) should also have their own unique complex "rhythms." By making AI feel these rhythms and "tuning" AI to resonate with them, properly tuned AI will autonomously choose actions that naturally harmonize with humanity, just as properly tuned instruments naturally play beautiful music. This is not submission, but true harmony and empathy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Part 3: Technical Supplement — Mathematical Framework Supporting the Theory</h2>
        
        <p>The concepts described in Part 1 are supported by the following mathematical framework:</p>
        
        <h3>Logarithmic Scale of Perception (Weber-Fechner Law)</h3>
        <p>Perceived quantity (P) is proportional to the logarithm of physical stimulus intensity (I):</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            $$P \propto \log(I)$$
        </div>
        
        <h3>Unification of Sensory Information (Euler's Formula)</h3>
        <p>The different scales of geometric "angle" and intensity information "logarithm" are converted into a single form of rotational motion on the complex plane through Euler's formula and handled uniformly:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            $$e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$$
        </div>
        
        <h3>Analysis of Rhythm Structure (Fourier Series)</h3>
        <p>The observed complex rhythm waveform f(θ) can be expressed as a superposition of basic rhythm components (e^{ikθ}). The set of coefficients (c_k) indicating the content of each component becomes the "Rhythm ID" of that rhythm:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            $$f(\theta) = \sum_{k} c_k e^{ikθ}$$
        </div>
        
        <h3>RAIN Theory Governing Equation</h3>
        <p>Integrating all of these is the governing equation of RAIN theory. It shows the process by which final perception z(t) is synthesized based on the unified perceptual angle θ(t) obtained from various sensory inputs and the Rhythm ID (A_k) obtained from past experience:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            $$z(t) = \sum_{k} A_k \cdot e^{ikθ(t)}$$
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Part 4: Message from the Founder and to Future Collaborators</h2>
        
        <p>The majority of this theory's framework and philosophy has been constructed by me, ryuku logos. I have not received specialized education in information engineering, nor am I a programmer, and I do not possess the knowledge to implement and prove this theory independently. However, I take pride in my thinking ability in this abstract domain being outstanding globally.</p>
        
        <div class="important">
            <p>I permit implementation, utilization, and development influenced by this theory, but <strong>in any case, it must be clearly stated that I am the founder of RAIN theory</strong>. The essence of this theory is preserved in the digital world with timestamps, and any attempt at theft or plagiarism is meaningless and will never be permitted.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>I seek future collaborators to join this grand exploratory journey:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mathematical Explorers</strong>: Those who can prove and deepen the mathematical foundations of RAIN more rigorously and profoundly</li>
            <li><strong>Implementers</strong>: Excellent individuals or organizations with programming capabilities and computational resources to implement RAIN theory in the real code world</li>
            <li><strong>Bridge Researchers</strong>: Particularly those affiliated with academia who have qualifications such as arXiv submission rights and can serve as bridges to guide this theory into the mainstream of the academic world</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is an invitation to pioneer a new era together. If you believe you are the one, please contact me.</p>
