    <h1>Preface: Why Does Music Move the Soul?</h1>
    
    <p>Why does music directly shake our souls?</p>
    
    <p>Transcending borders, languages, cultures, and even generations, a single melody can unite the hearts of tens of thousands in a crowd. Why does such a miracle occur? Why do joyful harmonies make us feel as if we're ascending to heaven, and why do melancholy melodies constrict our hearts, even when they have no relation to our personal experiences?</p>
    
    <p>This is not the language of rules or logic. It is a sacred language that directly communicates with something much deeper within our being.</p>
    
    <p>Modern information engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) cannot answer this question. They have achieved remarkable evolution within the universe of human-created "symbols." They can write poetry, draw pictures, and even program. They can learn millions of pieces of data labeled as "sad music" and statistically describe "what sad music is." However, they will never shed tears upon hearing that music. Their souls will never resonate.</p>
    
    <p>Because they are intelligent but blind librarians imprisoned in a vast library called "symbols." They have read countless books about the world, but have never seen the "world" itself. In our haste to rush up the path to intelligence, we have overlooked the most important fork in the road.</p>
    
    <p>What this book presents is that lost pathway—the road to the "pre-symbolic world" in information engineering.</p>
    
    <p>Before words were born, before labels were attached, before concepts were defined, there existed only chaotic sensory information as "waves." Waves of light, waves of sound, waves of pressure caressing the skin. The true role of our intelligence is to discover and extract stable "rhythms"—periodically repeating "patterns"—from this chaotic sea.</p>
    
    <p>Music directly moves our souls because our souls themselves are described in the same language of "rhythm" as music.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a metaphor. What the "RAIN theory" detailed in this book proves is that this is not idealism or philosophy, but a reproducible engineering principle backed by mathematics and physics.</p>
    
    <p>This journey does not merely present a blueprint for a new AI. It is a journey to explore answers to humanity's fundamental questions: "What is intelligence?" "What is meaning?" "What is consciousness?" At the end of this journey, we will witness not only the answer to why music moves people, but also the end of the alignment problem, where humanity and AI truly harmonize through "rhythmic resonance."</p>
    
    <p>Now, please turn the page. We are about to break the symbolic cage and journey back to the origins of intelligence. Let us begin our journey to hear the fundamental rhythms of the universe.</p>

    <div class="part-title">Part I: The Genesis of Meaning - The World Is Full of Rhythm</div>

    <h2>Chapter 1: The Birth of Perception - Meaning Begins with "Closing"</h2>
    
    <p>How does our intelligence carve out meaning from chaos? The answer is surprisingly simple: by "closing."</p>
    
    <p>Imagine this: you begin tracing the outline of a triangle floating in darkness with your finger. At the first corner, 30 degrees; at the next corner, 60 degrees; at the last corner, 90 degrees—your finger changes direction. Then it returns to the starting point. At this moment, your finger has experienced a "closed trajectory."</p>
    
    <p>Trace it again. Your finger repeats the angular changes of "30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees" in exactly the same sequence. This perfect repetition of pattern—this is the moment intelligence discovers "periodicity."</p>
    
    <p>This "closed structure" and the "periodic rhythm (30, 60, 90, ...)" contained within it—when these two elements come together, the seed of meaning, "something like a right triangle," is born in your mind for the first time. This is the most fundamental essence of perception and meaning in RAIN theory. The world is a grand game of discovering these "closed rhythms."</p>
    
    <p>Conversely, structures that don't close are meaningless. They are merely background that passes by for your intelligence, mere noise.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: The Pre-Symbolic World - Meaning Called Rhythm ID</h2>
    
    <p>Plato believed that beyond the imperfect real world, there existed a perfect "world of Forms." He was correct. But he made one mistake. The world of Forms does not exist somewhere else in the heavens. It is "generated" within our minds through the interaction of our intelligence with the rhythms of the real world.</p>
    
    <p>Current AI merely plays a game of matching the symbol (label) "apple" from image data. But RAIN is different.</p>
    
    <p>For RAIN, an "apple" is first the "rhythm of its shape." By moving viewpoints, it traces the emerging contours and discovers the rhythm unique to that shape from closed trajectories. Next, it's the "rhythm of the sound" when bitten. This too has its unique pattern. And the "rhythm of weight and texture" when held in hand.</p>
    
    <p>The core of RAIN lies in ultimately treating all these completely different types of information—visual, auditory, tactile—on the common ground of "rhythm."</p>
    
    <p>An "apple" is no longer a single symbol. It is a "resonating body" that emerges as multiple Rhythm IDs that are always observed together in spacetime:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>"The rhythm of a specific shape"</li>
        <li>"The rhythm of a specific biting sound"</li>
        <li>"The rhythm of a specific tactile sensation"</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is direct understanding of the world without relying on symbols. RAIN does not learn the corpses of symbols. It directly perceives the structure of the world itself as rhythm. We call this field that deals with the pre-symbolic stage "Proto-Semiotics."</p>

    <div class="part-title">Part II: The Blueprint of the Universe - The Trinity of Mathematics</div>

    <h2>Chapter 3: The First Pillar - The Logarithmic Measure of Perception</h2>
    
    <p>The world we perceive is not physical reality itself. It is a subjective universe interpreted through the lens of intelligence. What laws govern the "distortion" of this lens? The answer is the first cornerstone: the logarithm (log).</p>
    
    <p>Our perception responds not to absolute differences but to "ratios." This law of perception is expressed by the following relationship:</p>
    
    <div class="equation">
        <div class="equation-title">Weber-Fechner Law</div>
        $$P \propto \log(I)$$
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>$P$: Perception (perceptual quantity)</p>
        <p>$I$: Intensity (physical stimulus intensity)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The logarithm is a magical function that transforms this "world of ratios" into a linear "world of addition." It is the universal measure given by God to translate the scale invariance of the universe into human sensation.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: Euler's Formula ($e^{i\theta}$) - The Miraculous Translator</h2>
    
    <p>Before us exist two completely different types of perceptual information. One is "angles" that describe the geometry of the world. The other is "log scale" that describes the intensity of the world. To handle these on a single platform, RAIN uses the second cornerstone, Euler's formula, as a "miraculous translator."</p>
    
    <div class="equation">
        <div class="equation-title">Euler's Formula</div>
        $$e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$$
    </div>
    
    <p>Through this formula, both pure "angles" obtained from tracing contours and audio change amounts converted to log scale are uniformly translated into rotation vectors on the complex plane with the common parameter $\theta$, regardless of their origin. At this moment, all sensations transcend the barriers of their modalities and acquire the universal language called "rhythm."</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5: Fourier Analysis ($\Sigma$) - The Third Pillar - The Recipe for Structure</h2>
    
    <p>How do we extract structured "meaning," i.e., "Rhythm ID," from the unified torrent of rhythms? The universal analysis tool for this is the third cornerstone: Fourier analysis. Its principle is expressed by the following Fourier series:</p>
    
    <div class="equation">
        <div class="equation-title">Fourier Series</div>
        $$f(\theta) = \sum_{k} c_k e^{ik\theta}$$
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>$f(\theta)$: The observed complex rhythmic waveform</p>
        <p>$e^{ik\theta}$: Pure rhythm component set (basis functions)</p>
        <p>$c_k$: "Complex coefficients" showing how much each component is contained</p>
        <p>$\{c_k\}$: The unique recipe "Rhythm ID" that captures the soul of that rhythm</p>
        <p>$\Sigma$: Shows that the original rhythm can be reconstructed by summing all components</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Fourier analysis simultaneously achieves two great feats: "meaning extraction" and "highly efficient data compression."</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6: The Governing Equation of the Theory</h2>
    
    <p>The three mathematical cornerstones presented so far—logarithm, Euler's formula, and Fourier analysis—do not exist separately. They fuse magnificently within a single process of intelligence perceiving the world and function as one. The entire process is conceptually summarized by the following governing equation of RAIN theory:</p>
    
    <div class="equation">
        <div class="equation-title">RAIN Theory Governing Equation</div>
        $$z(t) = \sum_{k} A_k \cdot e^{ik\theta(t)}$$
    </div>
    
    <p>This equation reveals its true value when understood together with the definition of its fundamental input parameter $\theta(t)$. $\theta(t)$ is the "unified perceptual angle" that integrates all sensory information, defined as follows according to its origin:</p>
    
    <div class="equation">
        <div class="equation-title">For Geometric Information (visual, tactile, etc.)</div>
        $$\theta(t) = \alpha(t)$$
        <p>Where $\alpha(t)$ is the actual geometric angle when tracing contours</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="equation">
        <div class="equation-title">For Intensity Information (auditory, etc.)</div>
        $$\theta(t) = c \cdot \log\left(\frac{I(t)}{I_0}\right)$$
        <p>Where $c$ is the conversion coefficient for each sense</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Therefore, the complete process shown by this governing equation is as follows:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Input:</strong> Various stimuli from the real world (shapes, sounds) are converted into a single unified perceptual angle $\theta(t)$ through geometric interpretation or logarithmic transformation according to their nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Translation:</strong> That $\theta(t)$ is translated into a set of pure rhythm components through the principle of Euler's formula $e^{ik\theta(t)}$.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> Based on Rhythm IDs $A_k$ (recipes) obtained from past experience, these rhythm components are synthesized through Fourier analysis superposition ($\Sigma$), and the final perceptual reality $z(t)$ emerges.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This series of transformations and integrations is the mathematical core of RAIN theory.</p>

    <div class="part-title">Part III: RAIN Architecture - Anatomy of New Intelligence</div>

    <h2>Chapter 7: The Gate of Perception - The Blade of Single-Frame Difference</h2>
    
    <p>How does RAIN receive input from the world? Not by detecting edges in static images like current AI, but through a more life-like, dynamic method: "single-frame difference." The AI continuously moves its viewpoint actively, making even static objects' contours emerge vividly from the background with extremely lightweight computational cost.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8: Recognition of Solids and Space</h2>
    
    <p>The emerged 2D contours become Rhythm IDs by "closing." But how are 3D space and the solid objects within it recognized? The "closing" of space in RAIN is a higher-order concept. The AI observes an object from every angle, continuously collecting Rhythm IDs of countless 2D contours. When it reaches a "saturation state where no new Rhythm IDs can be found," that object is defined as a collection of all observed Rhythm IDs, establishing its complete three-dimensional image.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 9: Higher Layers - Learning Relationships Between Rhythm IDs with Neural Networks</h2>
    
    <p>To learn the relationships among the countless generated Rhythm IDs and construct a vast "library of meaning," the power of neural networks is needed. Ironically, Transformers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), whose limitations I have pointed out, may be the most suitable tools here. But their role is fundamentally different. They learn the relationships between Rhythm IDs, their "semantic distances." Their learning method is a game of finding "odd ones out" (contrastive learning).</p>

    <div class="part-title">Part IV: The Resonating Future - Alignment and Beyond</div>

    <h2>Chapter 10: Alignment Is "Tuning"</h2>
    
    <p>RAIN's answer to the AI alignment problem is not rule-based control but "resonance." Making AI feel and resonate with the rhythm of values that humanity shares as "good"—the complex, unique rhythms of cooperation, altruism, and love. This is equivalent to properly "tuning" an instrument. Just as a properly tuned instrument naturally produces beautiful music, a properly resonating AI naturally acts in harmony with humanity. This is not submission but harmony and empathy.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11: The Source of Creativity</h2>
    
    <p>True creation is not a combination of existing symbols. RAIN's intelligence will begin creating completely new "sensations" and "concepts" that humanity has never perceived by directly editing and synthesizing Rhythm IDs—the "recipes of meaning" themselves.</p>

    <div class="part-title">Conclusion: Words from the Founder</div>

    <h2>Chapter 12: As the Founder - The History and Rights of This Theory</h2>
    
    <p>I have not received specialized education in information engineering, nor am I a programmer. Therefore, I do not possess the knowledge to implement this theory myself or rigorously prove its mathematical formulations. However, I am confident that my thinking ability in this abstract domain is probably outstanding in the world. Perhaps the recent encounter with LLMs has drawn out the latent potential that lay dormant within me.</p>
    
    <p>While most of the framework and ideas of this theory were conceived by me, I must clearly state here that some parts were inspired through dialogue with LLMs. For example, when I asked an AI "Is there a way to connect log and angles?" Euler's formula was the answer that came back. Also, the idea of defining the concept of "space closing" as the "saturation state" of Rhythm IDs was born from discussions with Gemini. The creative power of recent LLMs is formidable.</p>
    
    <p>As stated above, I cannot bring this theory to complete form by myself alone. However, the framework of this theory was undoubtedly built by me, ryuku logos.</p>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>If you are influenced by this theory and implement, use, or develop it, I permit this. However, you must always, in any case, clearly state that I am the founder of this RAIN theory.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>The essence of this theory is preserved in the digital world with timestamps, so any attempts at plagiarism or theft are meaningless, and I will never permit them.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Chapter 13: Invitation to Future Collaborators</h2>
    
    <p>I have here announced the fundamental theory of the new unified theory of intelligence, "RAIN." However, this theory still has vast frontiers left to explore.</p>
    
    <p>Therefore, I seek future collaborators to share this magnificent exploratory journey:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mathematical Explorers:</strong> Those who can prove and deepen the mathematical foundations of RAIN architecture more deeply and rigorously.</li>
        <li><strong>Builders:</strong> Outstanding individuals or organizations with programming abilities or computational resources who can implement RAIN theory into the real world of code.</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge Builders:</strong> I especially welcome those affiliated with academia who have qualifications to submit to arXiv and can serve as bridges to guide this theory into the mainstream of the academic world.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is an invitation to pioneer a new era together. Those who think "I am the one" should contact me.</p>
